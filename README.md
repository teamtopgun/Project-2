# Project-2
WHat was the problem you were solving in this course?
In this course we solved the problem of understanding ways that computers deal with data.  Some ways may require more work, but acheve a faster output in the long-run
How did you approach the problem?
I used vectors in the final exam.  this was because the list was short, and would take no time to sort through, so complex data managment would have been a waste of time.
